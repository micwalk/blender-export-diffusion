# blender-export-diffusion
A Blender Add-on to add an export format that generates animation strings for the Deforum Diffusion notebook format. Ability to select a range of frames to export, multiple cameras, and does a basic pass at not including redundant keyframes.

Note: only supports 3d animation mode.

# Installation
Download/clone the repo, or just the file `export_diffusion.py`. In Blender go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`, click `Install` and select the `export_diffusion.py` file. You should then see a new add-on in the list called "Export Camera Animation to Diffusion Notebook String". Click the checkbox to enable. There should now be a new entry under `File > Export > Diffusion Notebook String`.

# Export Settings 
* Which Cameras
    * Active -- The single camera currently designated as "active" -- AKA the one shown in the render preview.
    * Selected -- Only selected cameras
    * All -- All cameras in scene
* Start Frame - Which frame to start from, inclusive. Note: the first frame will always be exporteds as frame 0
* End Frame - Which frame to stop at, exclusive. 
* Translation Scale -- How much to multiply blender world units by for the translate x,y,z values.
* Added export raw data - This option removes the clutter for ease of use copy/paste into webui. Working on webui import and parseq import.

# Usage Notes
After exporting, open the text file. All exported cameras will have their own block of strings. The strings are designed as python code you can copy/paste as a block into the notebook animation section.

For best results, set your Blender framerate and frame counts to match your notebook settings.
